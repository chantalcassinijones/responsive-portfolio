Second Challenge for Bootcamp in web-developing and UX


## Description

This was the second challenge for the University of Birmingham bootcamp in front-end web-developing and UX. In this challenge, I had to build a portfolio to showcase my projects and use it as a tool when ready to look for a job in tech.  

Guidelines for successful completition of this challenge included making sure that when the page is loaded it presents my name, recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work and how to contact me. The page had to be responsive, resizing when viewed with different devices. 

This challenge really tested my comphrension of both flexbox and CSS grid. I had to really dig deep into my learning and trialled a variety of layouts before reaching the final project. 


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This is a simple portfolio webpage. All you need to do is open the webpage with your browser. The navigation bar has clickable links that take you to each of the main sections of the page.
The section showcasing my projects is under construction and eventually will have clickable images which will link to the live projects. The contact me section, currently links to my GitHub account.
